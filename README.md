## ðŸ“‚ **Stage 0 : Problem Statement**
Understanding customer behavior deeply is crucial for creating more targeted marketing approaches. By considering various factors in customer interactions, companies can deliver more relevant and personalized experiences, enhancing customer satisfaction and driving overall sales growth. This approach ensures that every product or service offered aligns with customer needs, fostering loyalty and maintaining long-term relationships.

One effective method for analyzing customer characteristics and behavior is clustering. This technique allows companies to group customers into segments with specific similarities, enabling them to develop more tailored and relevant marketing strategies for each group. With more targeted strategies, companies can enhance customer experiences, build stronger relationships, and ultimately gain a competitive edge in the market.

The graph represents the results of the Elbow Method, preceded by PCA to reduce data dimensions while retaining information for optimal model performance.

The graph indicates that the optimal number of clusters is 4, as the decrease in variance becomes insignificant after the 4th cluster, meaning additional clusters do not provide valuable new information.
